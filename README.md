# Introduction to Python for OxNet

These Jupyter notebooks provide a self-study introduction to programming in Python. They are intended to be used as preparation for OxNet Science programme run by Pembroke College. 

## Jupyter Notebooks

The content in this repository is provided in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). There are many good online tutorials for using such notebooks (e.g. [1](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/), [2](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks)). 



## Running in SageMaker Studio Lab


## Getting started


Once you have set up the infrastructure described above for working with Python you should make a start with the provided notebooks. Each notebook covers a topic, with a number of exercises for completion at the end of each notebook. Download a zip of this repository with the following link: https://github.com/hawesie/a2-computer-engineering/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

Unpack the zip file then start with the notebook [A2 Introduction to Computer Engineering](00%20A2%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Engineering.ipynb). 

## Accompanying exercises

For each notebook there are a set of exercises in the directory
[Exercises](./Exercises/) for completion at end the of each Activity
