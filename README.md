# Introduction to Python for OxNet

Computing is best learned by doing, and seeking help when you need it. This course involves self-study, interactive Jupyter notebook 'activities', with exercises at the end of each activity. The activity notebooks cover the following topics. When you are ready to get started you should click on the first link below. Before you do that, read the rest of this file so you know what you're doing.

1. [Variables, assignment and operator precedence](01%20Variables,%20assignment%20and%20operator%20precedence.ipynb)
1. [Control statements](02%20Control%20statements.ipynb)
1. [Types, type conversions and floating point arithmetic](03%20Types,%20type%20conversions%20and%20floating%20point%20arithmetic.ipynb)
1. [Functions](04%20Functions.ipynb)
1. [Library functions](05%20Library%20functions.ipynb)
1. [Data structures](06%20Data%20structures.ipynb)
1. [Numerical computation](07%20Numerical%20computation.ipynb)
1. [Plotting](08%20Plotting.ipynb)
1. [Error handling and testing](09%20Error%20handling%20and%20testing.ipynb)


The notebooks are designed to be completed in order. To complete an activity:

1. Read through a notebook, and change parts of the programs if you want to experiment with what 
   happens - this will help your understanding. 
1. Try to complete the exercises for the notebook before moving onto the next activity.

As you move through the activities you might need to revise some of the earlier notebooks.

# Completing exercises

For the exercises, you complete them by replacing `raise NotImplementedError()` with your own code.

- Use Markdown cells, and where appropriate add equations, to describe what your program is doing.
- For longer exercises, you may want to break your program into multiple cells, with descriptions in Markdown before cells with code.
- Most exercises include some automated testing to provide feedback on the correctness of 
  your implementations. You will see these as `assert` lines. Don't worry, you are not expected to understand the test syntax to start.   
  
You are **not** required to present your exercise solutions as part of the course. However, completing the exercises will help you learn the material and prepare you for the programming parts of the OxNet programme.

# Jupyter Notebooks

This is a Jupyter Notebook. We will be computing using Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) and 
the programming language Python (https://www.python.org/).
Jupyter Notebooks  provide an interactive environment where you can mix text, equations, programming
and visual outputs. This is technology is increasingly widely used, and it is all open-source. 

If you are new to notebooks, see the notebook [Using notebooks](Using%20notebooks.ipynb) for guidance on how to interact with them. For more advanced tips and usage, see [Notebook tips](Notebook%20tips.ipynb).

Alternatively, there are many good online tutorials for using such notebooks (e.g. [1](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/), [2](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks)).
